  title: Reproducible Machine Learning Workflows for Scientists
  description: |
    Scientific researchers need reproducible software environments for complex applications that can run across heterogeneous computing platforms.
    Modern open source tools, like Pixi, provide automatic reproducibility solutions for all dependencies while providing a high level interface well suited for researchers.

    This tutorial will provide a practical introduction to using Pixi to easily create scientific and AI/ML environments that benefit from hardware acceleration, across multiple machines and platforms.
